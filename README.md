# Spin The Wheel Song Requests
Welcome to the super-official repo of the Spin The Wheel Song Requests show by [RadioJasper on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/radiojasper). This fun, interactive show sets up 2 battlers who compete against each other in a round of Spin The Wheel. Whatever category the wheel lands on, the 2 battlers have to pick a track in that category or by that artist - depending on which version of Spin The Wheel we're playing. Currently there are 2 types of wheels:

1. Category Edition 
2. Artists Edition

After both of the battlers picking a track, we'll have a good listen to them and somewhere halfway down the 2nd song, a Twitch poll will appear above chat, with the option to vote for your favorite track within that category or by that artist / band / group.

## Sounds simple?
Interactivity on Twitch needs to be light, airy and this is just that :)
